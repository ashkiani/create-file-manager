## Description
Create File Manager apps with no build configuration. This is the installer tool for the [file-manager-auth-mern](https://github.com/ashkiani/file-manager-auth-mern) template which is a boilerplate for Password Protected File Manager Apps with MERN.


## Quick Overview
```
npx create-file-manager-app APP-NAME
cd APP-NAME
npm install
```
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher)

Then update the .env file located in the app's root folder with your settings and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.
